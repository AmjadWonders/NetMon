## About

NetMon is a Python-based tool designed to assist data scientists and machine learning engineers in monitoring and visualizing the training process and performance of neural networks. It provides a convenient way to track training metrics and analyze data distributions during model development.

## Getting Started

To get started with NetMon, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before using NetMon, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

### Installation

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
```

### Usage

NetMon can be used to visualize the training history and data distributions during the training of neural networks. Below is an example of how to use NetMon in your Python code:

```python
from netmon import NeuralNetworkVisualizer

# Create a NetMon visualizer instance
visualizer = NeuralNetworkVisualizer()

# Simulate training process and update the history
for epoch in range(1, 11):
    loss = 0.1 * epoch  # Replace with actual loss values
    accuracy = 0.7 + 0.05 * epoch  # Replace with actual accuracy values
    visualizer.update_training_history(epoch, loss, accuracy)

# Plot training history
visualizer.plot_training_history()

# Simulate data distribution
data = np.random.randn(1000)  # Replace with actual data
visualizer.plot_data_distribution(data, title='Data Distribution')
```

### Features

Visualize training history (loss and accuracy) over epochs.
Plot data distribution for analysis.
Easy integration with your neural network training code.
